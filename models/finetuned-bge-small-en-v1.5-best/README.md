  - 'I Am Security

    Step into the shoes of a club security guard in "I Am Security," where your job
    is to keep the club safe and ensure only the right guests get inside. As a security
    guard, you’ll face a variety of challenges that will test your observation and
    decision-making skills.

    Story: Your main task is to identify who can enter the club and who can''t. Guests
    will line up, and you must decide if they are allowed in based on certain criteria.
    Some guests might try to sneak in with prohibited items, and it''s up to you to
    find these hidden objects. Use a range of tools, like metal detectors and scanners,
    to inspect the guests and uncover anything suspicious.


    To make things more interesting, the game offers a shop where you can buy new
    items and tools. These upgrades will help you improve your security skills and
    make your job easier. With every level, the difficulty increases, and you’ll encounter
    more complex scenarios and tougher decisions.


    "I Am Security" is all about quick thinking and sharp attention to detail. Will
    you be able to spot the troublemakers and keep the club safe?
